5. Preliminary operational concept of proposed system

5.1 Preliminary operational concept
The proposed system is to redesign the existing social application. The system aims to improve user experience by making the application more visually 
appealing and more user friendly. The system will have several operational features that will improve the overall functionality of the application, including 
a straight forwards interface along with better navigation, and also upgraded visual design. The system will allow users to connect with others who want to 
play sports or go to the gym together. The upgraded platform will provide users with a better experience that makes it easier for them to find others who are 
also interested in group exercising and playing sports. The proposed system will have individual and group modes of operation. The system will also include 
data privacy and security measures to protect the users information, also along with guidelines for appropriate use of the application. The owner of the 
application (The sponsor) will be able to provide ongoing technical support and maintenance to ensure the application is running smoothly.

a) operational policies and constraints;
The system will have security measures to make sure to secure user information. Also, the proposed system will implement rules to control user behavior and prevent wrong use on the platform. These policies and constraints will make sure that the application is used appropriately, and that user information is secure.

b) description of the proposed system;
The proposed system will redesign an existing social application by making the application more visually appealing and user-friendly which will improve user experience. It will have several operational features, including a straightforward interface, better navigation, and upgraded visual design, to improve the overall functionality of the application.

c) modes of system operation;
The proposed system will have two modes of operation, solo and team. In solo mode, users can set up a personal 
account, search and join groups, and interact with other users. In the other mode which is solo mode, users can 
create and administer their groups, invite other people to join the groups, and communicate with group members. 


d) user classes and other involved personnel; 
User classes will contain people who want to play sports or go to the gym with others. The proposed system 
will also involve administrator class which will be for the owners and operators of the application to provide 
technical support and maintenance. There will also be a third class for sponsors who will be able to 
advertise their events for a fee on the application.

e) support environment.
The proposed system needs to have a reliable internet connection and a compatible device to access the application. 
The administrators will provide ongoing maintenance and technical support to ensure the smooth operation of the platform.


5.2 Preliminary operational scenarios
(1) User sign-up 
A new user creates a profile on the application using their personal information and preferences for sports or gym activities.
(2) Group creation
An already existing user creates a new group for a specific sport or gym activity, creates the group's settings, 
and invites others to join. The user can manage the   group by adding or removing members and coordinating events.
(3) Event Planning
A group of users plan a sports or gym event, coordinating the details and inviting others to participate. 
They can communicate with each other within the application, sharing information and making plans.
(4) Event Participation
A user joins an event, either as an individual or as part of a group and participates in the sports or gym activity. 
They are able to interact with other participants and provide feedback on the event.
(5) User Feedback
A user provides feedback on the application, including recommendations for improvements and reporting any issues the application has.
The information is checked by the application administrators, who use it to enhance the application and fix any issues.
(6) Technical Support
An administrator provides technical support to users, resolving any technical issues and answering questions. 
They are able to monitor the application and ensure that it is functioning properly.


6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts

6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept
The acquisition of the system solution will involve engagement with our stakeholders. The stakeholders are the users, administrators, 
and sponsors. In order to define the requirements and make sure that the solution meets the stakeholder goals. The source of the 
solution will come from our developers or an external source, who can be contracted to design, produce, and verify the solution. 
The requirements definition process will involve information and goals from the stakeholders in order to define clear requirements. 
The solicitation and contracting procedure will include evaluating potential vendors and selecting the best solution based on the 
requirements. The design step will have us creating detailed plans for the solution, which will include the interface, navigation, 
and visual design, and it will make sure that the requirements are followed. The production stage will have steps to creating and testing
the solution, and the verification stage will include ensuring that the solution uses the requirements and the functionality is what was needed.

6.2 Preliminary deployment concept

The system solution will undergo validation through testing to ensure it meets requirements and words as expected. After that it will be delivered to stakeholders, 
which may be from installation, and configuration. There will be administrator and user training videos to help with installation and configurationg. 
The solution will be introduced incrementally and with monitoring and fixing issues to make sure everything is working as needed to be. Support and maintenance will be given to make sure the application keeps working properly. 

6.3 Preliminary support concept
Operating Support: The system needs a reliable internet connection and a compatible device to access the application. 
Ongoing technical support and maintenance will be provided by administrators to ensure the smooth operation of the platform.

Engineering Support: The design of the solution will include the interface, navigation, and visual design, which will need 
to be monitored and updated regularly to ensure the new changes are working properly.

Maintenance Support: The administrators will provide ongoing maintenance to make sure the application is running as intended and 
to fix any issues that may occur.

Supply Support: The requirements definition process will involve stakeholders to define clear requirements, and the solution will be acquired 
from our developers or an external source. The system solution will be delivered to stakeholders and introduced incrementally with monitoring and fixing any issues.

Training Support: The solution have administrator and user training videos to help with installation and configuration. 
This will help make sure that the new changes are working as needed.

6.4 Preliminary retirement concept
The system will be removed from operation and retired by responsibly removing the system and its components which includes any data 
and user information stored within the old system. This could involve backing up and transferring any important data along with removing 
any servers or hardware that work with the system to make sure that all the user information is properly secured and deleted.
It is important to not only apply this to user data but to also company data that can be compromised if not deleted properly.

7. Project Constraints
The project has several constraints that may impact it to be completed. The constraints are a limited budget, which may not be enough to cover all the necessary expenses such as development costs hardware and software costs and employee salaries. Unforeseen expenses may also arise during the project, such changes in project scope. Resource constraints can  impact the project, because the project may need more resources than planned. Examples are employees needing to work longer hours which will increase the cost of the project. Time constraints like a a short deadline, which in this case my sponsor wants to finish the project within a year and this can impact the project because going back to working hours the project team will probably need to work longer schedules in order to finish the deadline.
